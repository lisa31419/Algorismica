come as you are as you were
as I want you to be
as a friend as a friend
as a known enemy
take your time hurry up
choice is yours don't be late
take a rest as a friend
as an old
memoria memoria
come doused in mud soaked in bleach
as I want you to be
as a trend as a friend
as an old
memoria memoria
when I swear that I don't have a gun
no I don't have a gun
no I don't have a gun
memoria memoria
memoria memoria
and I don't have a gun
when I swear that I don't have a gun
no I don't have a gun
memoria memoria
